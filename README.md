This repository contains three IoT projects using the *ESP32* microcontroller.  
Each project demonstrates reading sensor values or generating test data and uploading them to *ThingSpeak Cloud* (or showing them in Serial Monitor).

## üìÇ Projects Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ ESP32 Temperature/Water Level Detector
- Uses an *analog temperature sensor (LM35/TMP36 or similar)* as a probe to detect water level.  
- When the sensor is dipped in water, the ESP32 reads a high ADC value (e.g., ~1032).  
- Can be used as a *basic water presence / level detection system*.  

*Key Features*  
- Reads ADC values (0‚Äì4095) from ESP32.  
- Threshold-based water detection logic.  
- Displays output in Serial Monitor.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ ESP32 Soil Moisture Sensor + ThingSpeak
- Uses a *Soil Moisture sensor* connected to ESP32.  
- Sends live soil moisture values to *ThingSpeak Cloud* for visualization.  
- LED blinks during WiFi search, then ESP32 uploads data.  

*Key Features*  
- Reads soil sensor values (0‚Äì4095 ADC range).  
- Optional inversion (dry ‚Üí high value, wet ‚Üí low).  
- Updates *Field 1* on ThingSpeak every 15 seconds.  
- Serial monitor shows sensor readings and update status.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ ESP32 ThingSpeak Counter Test
- A simple program to test *WiFi + ThingSpeak connectivity*.  
- Sends an *incrementing counter value (a = 0, 1, 2, ...)* to Field 1.  
- Useful for checking if your ESP32 setup works before adding sensors.  

*Key Features*  
- Blinking LED while searching for WiFi.  
- Sends data every 15 seconds to ThingSpeak.  
- Serial monitor shows DATA UPDATED.
